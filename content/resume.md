Current Linux Kernel Engineer at Canonical with 10 years of experience specializing
in the development of high-availability embedded devices, automated tooling, and performance optimization.
I have production experience in designing and deploying modern machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions.
My goal is to help teams produce great products by contributing my experience, willingness to learn and share, and by always trying
to do the right thing. I love learning new programming languages and technologies, deep-diving into zero-day exploits,
and finding new ways to be productive. My hobbies include geeking out with baking science, mountain biking, and keeping my 3D printer running.
