Cory has been writing software for Windows, Linux, and embedded devices for more than 10 years. From his early days of programming text-based RPGs
and his TI-83+ calculator, he has had a strong passion for solving interesting problems. He enjoys helping teams and systems work together by improving automation and identifying bottlenecks. Since completing his MS in computer science from Georgia Tech in 2018 he has found a renewed purpose in pursuing knowledge. His latest endeavors include
working on the Ubuntu Linux kernel, emulating a Mega Drive in C#, and re-discovering all the great things California has to offer.

He specializes in the following topics:

* Integrating embedded devices with Windows
* USB bulk, hid, and printer classes
* Computer vision for real-time processing
* Creating interpretable machine learning models


Future research projects include:

* Linux kernel security
* Reverse engineering (and defense)
* Bringing high-level tools to the embedded space
