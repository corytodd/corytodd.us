      <description>I am a strong advocate for using a coherent branching model when collaborating on software projects. It can be a full git-flow pattern, maybe GitHub flow, or some hybrid between them. There as many ways to do it as there are developers. Just be self-consistent and we&amp;rsquo;ll work well together. One feature that&amp;rsquo;s common across all branching models is the need for your target branches in sync. For example, with git-flow you cannot finish a feature if your local develop is behind origin develop.</description>
